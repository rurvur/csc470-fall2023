## C.O.W. Game
Created by Rhys Cabot in an absurd timecrunch from finals week

## ABOUT:
- Cow Game is a top down action roguelike where you evade progressively more dangerous waves of animals as a cow who can shoot fireballs by pressing 'P'.

## FEATURES:
- Not everything I set out to do!
- A working start menu
- Enemies that track the player
- 2-dimensional cow mooooovement
- Fireballs! (Will be in final version)
-(Additonal note: Fireballs will be replaced with landmines after the first enemy is slain)
- Leveling up to increase stats!
